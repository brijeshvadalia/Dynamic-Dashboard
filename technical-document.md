| Challenge                      | Solution Implemented                                            |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| No official APIs for all data  | Integrated **Yahoo Finance API** for CMP. Mocked **Google Finance data** for P/E ratio and earnings. |
| API Rate Limiting              | Implemented **Redis caching** with a 60-second expiry per stock symbol. |
| Asynchronous Data Fetching     | Utilized **async/await** and **Promise.all** for concurrent API requests. |
| UI Performance Optimization    | Applied **React.memo**, **useMemo**, and optimized state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders. |
| Real-time Data Updates         | Integrated **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** to push live stock price updates to the frontend. |
| Error Handling                 | Robust **try-catch blocks** in backend services with detailed logging for monitoring. |
| Periodic Refresh on Frontend   | Configured **15-second interval refresh** in the frontend for redundancy. |
